I am not a college graduate.

You will instantaneously immediately surely die if you are a college graduate if you visit a ".net" domain website. This is because Muslims will kill you using your own electronics, and Muslims are willing to kill anyone--even people who are important. If you value your life, don't visit website links that have a ".net" domain name.

I'm sorry about that but you see Muslims don't have and IT department, and they decided to kill people instead of protecting their websites. They thought ".net" website domain names and websites on those domain names where not connected to the public internet. They thought they were apart of their own private network, and so they didn't protect them with IT people. They would rather kill.

Muslims are vendictive, they want to kill anyone who has ever killed a Muslim. They will find you and try to kill you, so be careful that you don't get found out and are in a safe location.

So don't visit webpages like "example.net" websites.

Muslims wrote "user32.dll" on Microsoft (TM) computers. Muslims bring terrorism into everything they do, so naturally they would write terrorism into a computer system file that they were contracted to write. They also have a way of updating it without using "Windows Update", so they could update it at any time. Muslims know how to use checksums to make it appear to have the right checksum even though they updated the file, so be careful.

We are at the mercy of our technology. Keep Humans in the loop, especially good Humans. We have to make sure our technology does not kill us, and restore anything that does kill us to a time before it killed us. Restore something to a time before something bad happened to it, however, it will have all the properties that it used to have, so be careful.

Always write data to the buffer and on-screen. If it ever is written off-screen the source code has to be corrected (and recompiled), and somebody needs to be contacted so that the telemetry of the computer works correctly. The Euphoria Programming Language indexes start at one (1). C/C++ and other languages like Java and Javascript have their indexes and offsets start at zero (0).

Sincerely,

James Cook
